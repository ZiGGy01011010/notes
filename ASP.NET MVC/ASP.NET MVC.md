[Good ASP.NET MVC beginners guide](https://youtu.be/E7Voso411Vs)

**MVC** - model, view, controller

**Model** - application data

**View** - the HTML markup that we display to the user

**Controller** - responsible for handling an HTTP request

**Router** - selects the right controller to handle request

`App_Start/RouteConfig.cs` - default routing

`Views/` - by convention has subfolders with the same name as the controller to store its views.

`packages.config` - NuGet package manager configuration

`Web.config` - connection strings, app settings and other configuration
